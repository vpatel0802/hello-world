<!-- what i would like to accomplish in Web Design -->

Firstly, I'm here to seize every chance to study and develop. As a website developer, it is essential to have core knowledge of any language. As with my research, I got to know HTML, CSS and javascript are the root part of website design and development. So my first goal is to learn those languages and achieve all steps.
My major motivation is self-expression in being able to develop and design a website to be proud of. I want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material, which provide interactivity and be artistically pleasing to the user with the creativity to put all material together in a form that your audience will be able to use.
Another goal is to ensure website users have a good experience. If the user or audience does not understand or enjoy what you are presenting, you have not achieved a major goal of the process. To obtain user satisfaction I will make sure it works for all users, make it pleasing to the eye and get the audience to participate.
Finally, a web designer hopes for career rewards, such as good pay and advancement. This may be self-satisfaction, recognition from the audience or financial gain.
