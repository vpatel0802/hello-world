# hello-world

<!-- what i would like to accomplish in Web Design -->
Firstly, here i am to learn and grow using all opertunities. As a web-site developer it is esential to have core knowledge of any language. As with my research i got to know html, css and javascript is root part of website design and development. So my first goal is to learn those languages and achive all steps.
My major motivation is self-expression in being able to develop and design a web-site to be proud of. I want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material, which provide interactivity and be artistically pleasing to the user  with the creativity to put all material together in a form that your audience will be able to use.
Another goal is to make sure usres of the website have a good experience. If the user or audience does not understand or enjoy what you are presenting, you have not achieved a major goal of the process.To obtaine user satisfaction i will make sure it works for all users, make it pleasing to the eye and get the audience to participate.
Finally, a web designer hopes for career rewards, such as good pay and advancement. This may be self-satisfaction, recognition from the audience or financial gain.
